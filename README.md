# Fibonacci Series - Multi-Language Implementation

This repository contains implementations of the Fibonacci series in four different programming languages: Python, C, C++, and Java.

## ðŸ“Œ Files in the Repository

- `main.py`  â†’ Fibonacci in Python âœ… (Bug Fixed)
- `main.c`   â†’ Fibonacci in C
- `main.cpp` â†’ Fibonacci in C++
- `Main.java` â†’ Fibonacci in Java

## ðŸ›  Bug Fix in `main.py`
A bug was identified in `main.py`, which caused incorrect Fibonacci series output. The issue was resolved through a dedicated pull request, and the fix has been merged into the main branch.

### ðŸ”§ Steps Taken to Fix the Bug
1. **Created a new branch** `fix-bug-gitstudenthub-python`.
2. **Identified & fixed** the issue in `main.py`.
3. **Committed & pushed** the changes to the new branch.
4. **Opened a pull request** and merged it into the main branch.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Fibonacci Programs
### Python
```sh
python main.py
```

### C
```sh
gcc main.c -o fibonacci
./fibonacci
```

### C++
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o fibonacci
./fibonacci
```

### Java
```sh
javac Main.java
java Main
```
